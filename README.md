# Bloxpace.js
A javascript implementation of a block puzzle game that I've originally created for Android. The goal is to clear lines and columns of blocks by filling the board with shapes.

## Scoring
- For every shape you place, you receive a number of points equal to the blocks that make up the shape.
- For every line or column you clear, you receive 8 points.
- For every combination of lines and columns you clear, you receive 25 points.
